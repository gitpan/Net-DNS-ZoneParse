Net-DNS-ZoneParse version 0.0101
================================

Net::DNS::ZoneParse can be used to parse or write BIND-compatible Zonefiles.
The zone can be accessed as a array of Net::DNS::RR-objects or be handled via
an object-oriented interface.

The Module is built to make use of any RR known to the system - a corresponding
Net::DNS::RR::xxx must be installed. Due to some differences between parsing a
packet and a system's file, the parsing can be adjusted.

The Parser as well as the Generator can be used in conjunction with any real
Parser or Generator, as long as a suitable gluecode exist.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

Net::DNS::RR to save the records
